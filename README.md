# StoreOrdersAnalysis_DA_Batch1

# Introduction
We made this project as apart of training Data analysis using python in AI approach club. We chose a Dataset that represents an international store with a huge data for a period of three years. The data analysis includes the relationship among almost all the columns and study the relation between profits & losses with the other parameters within the data.

# Objective
This analysis aimed to:
•	See the factors that will enhance the store performance and increase profits.
•	Discover the factors that bring losses to the store.
•	Make many charts and visualizations to ease the understanding of data.
•	Take a set of decisions that will help to improve the store performance.

# About the dataset
The sample Dataset includes data for the Sales of multiple products sold by the store along with subsequent information related to geography, Product categories, and subcategories, sales, and profits, segmentation amongst the consumers, etc. This sample Dataset presents a common use case, from which you could gather useful insights from the Sales data in order to improve the Marketing and Sales strategies. you can learn about various operations and elements using this sample Dataset and come up with better strategies to improve and grow the business more.
DataSet columns:
1.	'order_id'
2.	'order_date'
3.	'ship_date', 
4.	'ship_mode',
5.	'customer_name',
6.	'segment'
7.	'state'
8.	'country'
9.	'market'
10.	'region'
11.	'product_id'
12.	'category'
13.	'sub_category'
14.	'product_name'
15.	'sales', 'quantity'
16.	'discount'
17.	'profit'
18.	'shipping_cost'
19.	'order_priority'
20.	'year'
# Steps
1.	Importing Libraries
2.	Access to csv file in my drive files
3.	Read the Dataset and check the head
4.	DATA Cleaning
5.	check information
6.	data statistics
7.	analyzing consumer countries
8.	Analyzing for just top 3 consumer countries orders as per categories and sub-categories
9.	Analyzing for just top 3 consumer countries orders as per segments and sub-categories
10.	Analyzing shipping mode for each market
11.	Analyzing shipping mode for each region
12.	Analyzing the most common columns in the dataset
13.	Growth in sales of products over years
14.	Analyzing Profits
15.	Analyzing losses
16.	The decision


# Conclusion
This project is an application of what we have learned along the Data Analysis Course and we tried to show and visualize almost all the relations and columns within the data.
For each step within the project implementation, we support the codes with comments and description, and at the end we put our own decisions according to what we have seen from analysis. 

**We are glad to receive any comments or notes.**
